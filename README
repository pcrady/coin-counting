To run the relevant code just run $jupyter notebook money.ipynb

If you want to try your hand at training your own cascade filter run: 
data/opencv-haar-classifier-training/script.sh 

I do not recommend doing that since it took me like 6 hours to train the 
cascade filter on a 16 core cpu. Also I'm pretty sure it will overwrite 
the existing weights so you should move data/opencv-haar-classifier-training/classifier
to data/opencv-haar-classifier-training/classifier.bak first so you dont 
overwrite anything.

You will need opencv, opencv for python (whatever its called for the distrution your working on)
and keras. I used keras with a tensorflow backend.
